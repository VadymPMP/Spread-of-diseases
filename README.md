# Spread-of-diseases a desktop application that allows the user to simulate the spread of disease by entering the appropriate differential equations. 
It is based on the implicit Runge-Kutti method modified by Lobato. 
The program also allows you to solve various systems of differential equations - rigid systems and non-rigid systems. 
The program makes it possible to predict the behavior of the coronavirus, 
but requires constant mathematical analysis and adjustment of input data, because it is based solely on mathematical models.
